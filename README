 High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark (HPL)
 HPL 2.0 - September 10, 2008
==============================================================

 HPL is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear
 system  in   double  precision  (64   bits)   arithmetic   on
 distributed-memory  computers.   It can thus be regarded as a
 portable as well as  freely  available implementation  of the
 High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.

 The  HPL  software  package requires the availibility on your
 system of an implementation of the  Message Passing Interface
 MPI  (1.1 compliant).  An  implementation of either the Basic
 Linear Algebra Subprograms  BLAS  or the  Vector Signal Image
 Processing Library VSIPL is also needed.  Machine-specific as
 well as generic implementations of MPI, the  BLAS  and  VSIPL
 are available for a large variety of systems.

Repository synchronization
===

Synchronization of the code from its
[source](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/index.html) is
made by downloading the tarball, then extracting it, “rsyncing”
it with --delete option and excluding README (which is merged
manually) and the .git directory. Finally, we check the changes
manually, merge what needs more precautions, commit the changes,
and tag the version. Here is the command set used for syncing
version 2.0 (from hpl directory):

    curl -o ../hpl-2.0.tar.gz https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/hpl-2.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf ../hpl-2.0.tar.gz -C ../
    rsync -a --exclude '.git' --exclude CHANGELOG ../hpl-2.0/ ./ --delete
    # Review changes before commiting, update Changelog and README
    git add .
    git commit -Am 'Version 2.0'
    git tag v2.0
    git push

## [2.3] - 2018-12-02

Piotr Luszczek removed deprecated MPI functions that are no longer
supported in some MPI implementations (for example Open MPI 4.0) and
replaced them with
modern equivalents in HPL_packL():
-- [M] src/comm/HPL_packL.c

Piotr Luszczek added one digit to the display of performance result
and changed display of scaled residual to scientific notation with
extra digits in HPL_pdtest():
-- [M] testing/ptest/HPL_pdtest.c

Piotr Luszczek added support for Autotools configuration packages
autoconf and automake:
-- [A] Makefile.am
-- [A] configure.ac
-- [A] acinclude.m4
-- [A] src/Makefile.am
-- [A] testing/Makefile.am

## [2.2] - 2016-02-24

Piotr Luszczek added continuous reporting of factorization progress
submitted by Intel and make scripts that uses Intel software tools and
libraries and their Apple's Mac OS X equivalents.

## [2.1] - 2012-10-26

Piotr Luszczek introduced exact time stamping for HPL_pdgesv():
 -- [M] dist/include/hpl_misc.h
 -- [M] dist/testing/ptest/HPL_pdtest.c

 Piotr Luszczek fixed out-of-bounds access in data spreading functions. exact time stamping for HPL_pdgesv():
 -- [M] dist/src/pgesv/HPL_spreadN.c
 -- [M] dist/src/pgesv/HPL_spreadT.c
 Thanks to Stephen Whalen from Cray.

## [2.0] - 2008-09-10

Piotr Luszczek changed to 64-bit RNG, modified files:
-- [M] include/hpl_matgen.h
-- [M] testing/matgen/HPL_ladd.c
-- [M] testing/matgen/HPL_lmul.c
-- [M] testing/matgen/HPL_rand.c
-- [M] testing/ptest/HPL_pdinfo.c

For a motivation for the change, see:
  Dongarra and Langou, ``The Problem with the Linpack
  Benchmark Matrix Generator'', LAWN 206, June 2008.

-- [M] testing/ptest/HPL_pdtest.c  --

Julien Langou changed the test for correctness from
    ||Ax-b||_oo / ( eps * ||A||_1  * N            )
    ||Ax-b||_oo / ( eps * ||A||_1  * ||x||_1      )
    ||Ax-b||_oo / ( eps * ||A||_oo * ||x||_oo * N )
to the normwise backward error
    || r ||_oo / ( eps * ( || x ||_oo * || A ||_oo + || b ||_oo ) * N )
See:

Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA, USA,
Second Edition, pages = xxx+680, ISBN = 0-89871-521-0, 2002.

Note that in our case || b ||_oo is almost for sure
1/2, we compute it anyway.

## [1.0b] - 2004-12-15

- Fixed problem with 32-bit integer overflow.
  Thanks to John Baron.

Weakness of the pseudo-random matrix generator found for pro-
blem sizes being power of twos and larger  than 2^15;  Thanks
to Gregory Bauer. This problem has not been fixed. It is thus
currently recommended to  HPL  users willing to test matrices
of size larger than 2^15 to not use power twos.

When the matrix size is such that one needs  > 16 GB  per MPI
rank,  the  intermediate  calculation  (mat.ld+1) * mat.nq in
HPL_pdtest.c  ends up  overflowing  because  it is done using
32-bit arithmetic.  This issue has been fixed by  typecasting
to size_t; Thanks to John Baron.

## [1.0a] - 2004-01-04

- Added Row- or Column-major process mapping in data file
- Fixed compilation error for gcc 3.3 in walltime.

The  MPI  process grid  numbering  scheme  is now an run-time
option.
The inlined assembly  timer  routine that caused the compila-
tion to fail when using  gcc  version 3.3  and above has been
removed from the package.
Various building problems on the T3E have been fixed;  Thanks
to Edward Anderson.

## [1.0_] - 2004-01-04 - Unflagged modifications

A couple of mistakes in the  VSIPL  port have been
corrected.  The tar file as well as the web site were updated
on September 27th, 2000.  Note  that  these problems were not
affecting the BLAS version of the software in any way.

## [1.0] - 2000-09-09

Public release of Version 1.0
